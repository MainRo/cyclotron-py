Welcome to Cyclotron's documentation!
=====================================

Cyclotron is a functional and reactive framework for python, asyncio, and
`RxPY <https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY/>`_. It is inspired from the
`CycleJs <https://Cycle.js.org>`_ javascript framework. Cyclotron makes it
easy to write asynchronous reactive applications in a functional way.
